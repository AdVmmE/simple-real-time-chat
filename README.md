## Introduction
This project is a simple real-time chat system where users can connect via a web interface, send messages, and see updates instantly. It uses Socket.IO for real-time communication and MongoDB to persist messages until all users disconnect. The application is designed for simplicity and can serve as a foundation for more complex chat systems.

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets.
- **Message Persistence**: Messages are stored in MongoDB and loaded for new users.
- **Auto-Scroll**: Chat window scrolls to the latest message automatically.
- **Message Cleanup**: All messages are deleted from the database when a user disconnects (currently deletes on any disconnectâ€”work in progress).
- **Sent/Received Styling**: Sent messages are styled differently from received ones.
